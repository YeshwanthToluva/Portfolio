Hello! I'm Yeshwanth.

I am a passionate developer and cloud enthusiast with a knack for building innovative solutions. I specialize in Cloud Computing, Full-Stack Development, and System Administration. From crafting scalable architectures to developing intelligent systems, I love solving real-world problems.

I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) (2nd year) at a top CS college. Alongside my studies, I actively work on projects related to AI/ML, cybersecurity, and gesture-based system control.

I have earned AWS, Google, and IBM certifications and founded a student club to educate peers about cloud technologies. My contributions extend to open-source projects and hackathons, where I love collaborating and building impactful solutions.

Here are a few other activities I love to do!
